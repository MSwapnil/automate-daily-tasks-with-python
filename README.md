# automate-daily-tasks-with-python

I was tired of logging in to multiple websites first thing in the morning everyday. So I decided to automate this daily task.

For now, this python script will automatically open a Chrome window, using my work Chrome Profile and will log in to Salesforce using the credentials provided in the YAML file.

We are not using the login credentials directly in the code. We store those in a separate YAML file (credentials.yaml), and then pass them to the python script.

More functionality will be added in future commits.
